To remove a window you spawned with this plugin, use the Remove Picture command. If you display a Picture with the same ID as a custom window, the window will be overwritten, and vice-versa. Use negative IDs for the windows. If you use positive IDs, they'll be drawn on top of other screen elements.","name":"Multiple window boxes","type":1,"version":"1.0.2"}
